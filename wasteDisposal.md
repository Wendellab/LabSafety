# Instructions for Waste Disposal

Below is a brief summary of waste disposal instructions appliable to our lab, please refer to [ISU Waste and Recycling guidelines] (http://publications.ehs.iastate.edu/warg/files/assets/basic-html/page-1.html#) for details.

* **Accumulated chemical waste**: store in Satellite Accumulation Area (SSA) up to 90 days or 10 gallons, contact EH&S for removal using the online [Waste Removal Form](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/waste/wasteremoval) to generate pickup request.
* **Plastic pipette tips, plastic pipettes**: theoretically, we need to put them in cardboard box labeled with “Plastic Sharps”, then discard the boxes in dumpster; however, if we make sure to bring all trash bags containing them directly to the dock dumpster downstairs by ourselves, it is ok to discard them in trash bags.
* **Lab ware, broken glass, glass pipettes**: placed in the yellow container by sink (east side of lab). Once full, bring the whole container to the dock downstairs and call FP&M (2944-5100) to request a pickup.
* **All empty chemical bottles**: leave in SSA, NO Green Tag required, request EH&S for pick-up.
* **All syringes, needles, blades**: leave in puncture resistant container, Label “Non-infectious”, Request EH&S for pick-up.
