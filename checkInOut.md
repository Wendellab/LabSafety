# Laboratory Orientation and Check-out

## Laboratory Check-In

Below summary is modified based on the [ISU Laboratory check-in Form](http://www.ehs.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/forms/LabCheckin.pdf).

**All researchers who work in laboratories need to follow instructions below to meet the requirement of lab safety.** Researchers include faculty members, staff, visiting scientists, post-doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students, and workers hired on an hourly basis. 

No research shall begin until each category in this form has been initialed and dated, and the completed form reviewed and approved by the appropriate supervisor or lab manager.

* Read the [ISU Laboratory Safety Manual](http://www.ehs.iastate.edu/publications/manuals/labsm.pdf), know its location in our laboratory (paper copy in binder and bookmarked on lab computer) and agree to follow the policies and procedures specified therein.
* Complete a [Hazard Inventory Form](http://www.ehs.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/forms/hazardinventory.pdf) and sent it to EH&S. A new form needs to be completed when changing job positions, work responsibilities and/or if workplace hazards change (including starting a new lab method).
* Take a new training needs assessment survey at [Learn@ISU](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/my-eh-s/training), and complete all required training courses offered by EH&S online or in a classroom. Submit copies of training records to the lab safety manager for filing.
* Take the **Lab-Specific Training** concerning lab hazards, the use & function of lab specific equipment, the location of safety equipment and the safe handling and storage of chemicals in the research laboratory. Sign relevant training completion forms.
* Review the [Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)](SOP/README.md) for all lab processes that will be performed involving chemical, biological and radioactive materials. Make sure to understand that new SOPs must be developed whenever new research methods are developed in the lab during the stay and must be reviewed the lab supervisor.
* Be responsible for keeping personal workspace clean and assisting with regulatory compliance efforts in the laboratory that may include routine laboratory inspections.
* Understand that research may need to be conducted at all hours of the day. If **working alone** in case of an emergency during a particular experiment, take measures to ensure that others are aware of your location and have someone check in with you from time to time, either in person or by telephone.
* Have access to and know the location of the **Safety Data Sheets (SDS)** in lab that describe hazards of chemicals in the laboratory.
* Read and understand the information concerning **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** contained in the Laboratory Safety Manual. Wearing gloves, safety glasses or goggles and a lab coat are required for laboratory work when working with chemicals or biohazard.
* Understand the proper procedures for [Waste disposal](wasteDisposal.md) (i.e., managing unwanted laboratory materials) in the research laboratory.
* **When injured** at work, report the injury to supervisor who will assist you in seeking medical treatment as stated in section I of the Laboratory Safety Manual.
    * For *non-life threatening treatment*: employees report to McFarland Clinic Occupational Medicine Office (294-4496); students report to ISU Student Health Center (294-5802).
    * For *life threatening treatment*: employees and students call 911 (remember to state that you are at Iowa State University)
    * *After hours*: employees, students report to Mary Greeley Medical Emergency Dept. (515-239- 2011)
* Review the lab **Emergency Action Plan** that is posted on front door: understand that in the event of fire or severe weather, the research group will assemble on the east side of Bessey hall; be responsible to help to check that everyone in the research group is accounted for.
* Make sure to know the location of **Emergency Equipment** (i.e., first-aid kit, fire extinguisher, safety shower, eyewash, spill kits, etc.) and their function in lab.
* Before using any **laboratory specific equipment**, receive training in their proper use and function.
* Keep **research records**, and understand the laboratory recordkeeping practices specified and where lab notebook, research documents and computer data files should be stored.
* Understand that before leaving the lab, completing a check-out procedure is required, see next.

## Laboratory Check-out
Below summary is modified based on the [ISU Laboratory check-out Form](http://www.ehs.iastate.edu/forms/LabCheckout.pdf).

Before leaving the laboratory, complete a checkout procedure that includes:

* Submit request for pick up of unwanted materials to EH&S and containers placed in the Satellite Accumulation Area with tags completed.
* Properly label and store all chemical containers used.
* Prepare a complete inventory of all research products remaining behind.
* Ensure that notebooks and data records are in order (Notebooks and data are the property of Iowa State University and cannot be removed; however copies can be made for writing up publications). The locations and organization of notebooks, data and computer files need to be clarified.
* Return all keys to General Services.
