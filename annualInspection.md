Below procedures should be conducted annually in lab, (usually in November).

* Review and update training history for lab personnel. See [ISU safety training curriculum](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/publications/handouts/labcurriculum.pdf) for required courses. Currently (updated in 2017 Nov), core rquired courses are: 
    * Laboratory Safety: Core Concepts (every 3 years)
    * Emergency Response Guide Video (every 3 years)
    * Fire Safety and Extinguisher Training (annually)
* Conduct safety surveys using the [Biosafety Level 1](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/laboratory/forms/survey-forms) criteria.
* Renew EHS research material inventories, including [Chemical inventory](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/laboratory/chemical-inventory) and [Biological Material Inventory](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/biological/biological-materials-inventory).
